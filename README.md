- 👋 Hi, I’m Nour Siwar
- 👀 I’m interested in learning other languages and improving my skills on C++.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ as well as programming concepts and fundamentals of programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to do together, I am unsure of what type of projects am I interested in so I am down for mostly anything.
